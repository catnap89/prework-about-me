      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
          On many nights, I used to walk around my neighborhood with my friend talking and sharing ideas that we had in our minds. We had many ideas but we didnâ€™t have the knowledge and skills to make it happen. We were doing nothing more than just daydreaming. I found it really attractive that as a web developer that those ideas could be visualized, built, and used by people. One day, I wish to see my daydreams become a reality.
